      "Graduation from HUFLIT with a Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology",
    year: "March 2025",
    category: ["Academic", "HUFLIT", "Graduation"],
    content: `After years of late-night coding sessions, group projects, and countless cups of coffee, I finally crossed the finish line — I graduated from HUFLIT with distinction in Information Technology.
This moment wasn’t just about receiving a degree. It was about the journey: the challenges I faced, the mentors who guided me, and the friendships that made it all worthwhile. I still remember the excitement of building my first backend system, the nerves before presenting in front of the faculty, and the quiet pride of seeing my efforts recognized.
Graduating with distinction is a reflection of the dedication I poured into every assignment, every exam, and every opportunity to grow. Now, with this chapter behind me, I’m stepping into the tech industry with confidence, curiosity, and a deep appreciation for the foundation HUFLIT has given me.
Here’s to the next adventure — and to never stopping learning.`,
